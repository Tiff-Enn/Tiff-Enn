- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to work closely with the military to roleplay scenarios the soldiers would likely face when sent out to other countries. That included disaster scenarios, wartime scenarios and relation-building scenarios.
- ⚡ The most notable thing I remember most about roleplay was a wartime scenario where I had makeup applied to my face to look like I was hit with shrapnel from an explosive. I actually made someone cry!
